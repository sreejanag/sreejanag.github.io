			<b>NASA AMES RESEARCH CENTER, USA</b><br>
<b><i>Position Title: </b></i>Research Engineer (June 2014-present) <br>
  <b><i>Research: </b></i>Design and optimization of the satellite constellations and formation flight for Earth Observation based on tight coupled Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSE). Developed the framework in collaboration with the Mission Design Center and Earth Science Division and applied it to diverse applications such as solar occultation measurements of the Earth ionosphere and air traffic monitoring in remote areas. Continuous space-based coverage of remote airspaces (e.g. Alaska, Greenland) using ADS-B signal reception from aircrafts is proven and optimal constellations are chosen based on tracked airplanes, certainty of their states, delay in relaying to ground and packet cost.

<b><i>Position Title: </b></i>Research Engineer(June-August 2012, June 2013-February 2014, August 2015-present) <br>
  <b><i>Research: </b></i>With the Science Directorate - Design and evaluation of nanosatellite clusters in formation flight to make multi-spectral, multi-angular radiometric measurements for the estimation of bi-directional reflectance distribution functions (BRDF) for the major global biomes. Improvement in BRDF estimation over and above current monolithic systems directly reflect in more accurate estimations of gross primary productivity (GPP) of vegetation and of the Earth Radiation Budget (ERB). The optical payload has been modeled and the proposed nanosatellite constellation design benchmarked with respect to available nanosatellite subsystems.

<b><i>Project Collaborators: </b></i>DARPA, Aurora Flight Sciences, TopCoder<br>
  <b><i> Research: </b></i>Designing, programming and managing the SPHERES Zero Robotics Program, a series of robotics programming tournaments for students aboard the International Space Station. The MIT SSL developed the SPHERES laboratory environment aboard the ISS to provide researchers with an experimental testbed for the validation of high risk  control for use in formation flight, autonomous docking, rendezvous and reconfiguration algorithms. Zero Robotics (ZR) enables students - high school, middle school and college level - to participate directly in the science conducted aboard the ISS. The software framework for this program is built in collaboration with TopCoder by crowdsourcing the development to their 300,000 strong community of members via a series of contests. The program itself incentivises thousands of students to play challenging games relevant to current space systems research i.e. they provide insightful solutions to topics on formation flight, strategic mission planning, fuel optimization, etc. Crowdsourcing not only develops the program but is also demonstrate it within the program itself.

<li><b><i>Position Title: </b></i>MIT Graduate Research Fellow (March-May 2010)<br>
<b><i> Project Collaborators: </b></i>Orbital Sciences Corporation, VA<br>
  <b><i> Research: </b></i> Performed an in-depth analysis of publicly-available  fractionated satellite value-centric design tools from Phase 1 of the  DARPA System F6 program. The first task focused      on a comparative benchmarking study of the four tools in which several use cases were modeled to determine differences in inputs, analysis methods, and outputs. The results found the   tools to be substantially diverse in modeling architectures and value interpretation. The second task applied optimization methods to the Phase 1 PIVOT tool created by Orbital Sciences   to maximize satellite system value. The results found solution stability is inhibited by uncertainties introduced by the stochastic objective function.

Data rates more than 2 MBps were proven possible with microwatt scale power and within Lincoln Lab available capabilities, laser modulation scheme, aperture, gimbal and APD technologies. From the mission geometries, availability was calculated to be between 6 to 13 hours per night. This report is a pre-PDR proposal to fly LaserComm on the team 'Next Giant Leap'.

<b><i>Research: </b></i>Demonstrated the scatter maneuver technique using swarm intelligence and equilibrium shaping applied to a fractionated spacecraft, treated as a multi-agent system, with a limited (but scalable to large) number of heterogeneous satellites with limited communication, collective reconfiguration and distributed computing abilities. Feedback controls were added, technology enablers benchmarked and benefits of autonomous collision avoidance in an uncertain environment with many agents clearly demonstrated. The modular, miniaturized subsystem of CubeSATs was used for the demonstration purposes.

<b><i>Research: </b></i>Proposed the idea and applied Full-waveform inversion (FWI) (via using Finite Difference Scheme, Filtered Gradient inversion, stochastic fractals) to the very complicated region known to have created the Earth's crust, the mid-Atlantic Ridge. Usually, FWI due to its complexity and unparalleled accuracy is used primarily in Computerized Brain Scanning. Implemented a processing sequence for vertical seismic profiles from the International Ocean Drilling Program Hole 1256D to check the presence of sub-basement reflections in the Multi-channel seismic profiles.

<b><i>Position Title:</b></i> Summer Intern in Instrumentation Engineering (April to July 2006)<br>
<b><i>Research:</b></i> Cancerous tissue shows 10 times more elastic than optical change, at a much earlier stage. I computationally solved for elastic parameters directly by using the novel synthesis of photo-elasto-acoustic or a simultaneous 3 wave propagation (via Eikonal, Naviers', Diffusion and Coupled PT Equation), rather than use dependency on a sequential secondary source. This proposes to detect cancer (Lame's Parameters via Finite Element Method) much earlier, more accurately.
